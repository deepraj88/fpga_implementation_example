2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net a_reg[15]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin a_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell a_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net a_reg[23]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin a_reg[23]_i_1/O, cell a_reg[23]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net a_reg[31]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin a_reg[31]_i_1/O, cell a_reg[31]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net a_reg[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin a_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell a_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net b_reg[4]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin b_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell b_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
